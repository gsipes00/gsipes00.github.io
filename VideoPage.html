                    <h2>Video Projects!</h2>
                    <p>I own a DJI Spark named Jarvis II (Jarvis I crashed), and it's fun to shoot some video and put music to it. Over the coming months 
                        I hope to expand this section to include better and better content. So far most of my contect focuses on family.<br /></p>

                            but I put this little video together with some footage I shot during a visicous little snow storm we experienced back in Feb. 2021, it's cleverly dubbed "Snovid". I backed the video with some beautiful music by the late and great poet Vaughn Benjamin.

                            <p>Cardano gets a lot of heat from the crypto space and is often referred to as a "Ghost Chain". The Cardano ecosystem is still evolving, but with the Alonzo upgrade that occured on September 12th, the blockchain was enabled to run smart contracts, and soon enough we will see a Cambrian explosion of decentralised applications!
                            To commemorate the spooky season, the Fall weather, and the "Ghost Chain's" success, meet the spicy, yet sweet with facetious irony "Ghost Pepper Chain".
