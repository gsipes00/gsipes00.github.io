                    <h2>Cardano Peppers!</h2>
                    <p>I love hot peppers... and the Cardano community is fired up about NFTs. So I've decided to join the fun and the madness, and mint some collectables.<br />
                    Corresponding to each season of Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring each collectable will be designed to a witty Cardano theme.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What are NFTs? Non-Fungible Tokens. Essentially they are collectables, art, and any other non-fungible
                        asset which are minted on the blockchain to legitimize uniqueness, onwership, and peer to peer transfer therof.
                        When purchasing NFTs always check that the policy ID in the marketplace matches the policy ID advertised by the artist, 
                        so that you know you are purchasing the real deal.</h4>

                            <p>A dear friend named Randy started a salsa company some years ago to help fund his medical needs. He asked me to take an old drawing he had and reproduce it as vector art to make labels and shirts. 
                                As a novice with vector art this was the result, more or less. Randy has since passed and to pay homage to him, I minted it on the blockchain. This sweaty Jalapeno represents the heat of Summer, and the heat of competition among DEX's. 
                                Further, Jalapeno's are commonly used in "Tex-Mex" cuisine near the Texas-Mexico border. So this little guy is cleverly dubbed the "Dex-Mex".

                            <h4>Fall Collectable, "Ghost Pepper Chain"</h4>
                            <p>Cardano gets a lot of heat from the crypto space and is often referred to as a "Ghost Chain". The Cardano ecosystem is still evolving, but with the Alonzo upgrade that occured on September 12th, 
                            the blockchain was upgraded to run smart contracts, and soon enough we will see an explosion of decentralised applications built on Cardano!
                            To commemorate the spooky season, the Fall weather, and the "Ghost Chain's" success, meet the spicy, yet sweet with facetious irony "Ghost Pepper Chain".
